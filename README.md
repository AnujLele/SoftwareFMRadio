ECE 1895 Design Project #3

The goal of this project is to write a SDR FM radio application, with an interactive GUI for the user to view the available stations, view the currently playing song, and view the station name. The user then can select a channel and hear the audio in real time. 

The main file is kept under pyqt5Example.py with the main source code interfacing with the GNURadio flowgraph under FMRadio.py.
